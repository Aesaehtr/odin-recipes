# odin-recipes

This is the first project in the Odin Project curriculum, it is supposed to get me started with learning HTML.

At the end of this project I should have been able to create a basic website containing a Homepage and links to a few recipes, it will not be pretty initialy but we will revisit this project to improve it's appearance later in the curriculum.
